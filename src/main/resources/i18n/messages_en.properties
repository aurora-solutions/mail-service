# for sending emails. The service is configurable via a properties file
# to allow for customizing configuration including SMTP mail properties.
# The project also leverages Thymeleaf Template enigne for defining
# HTML email templates. The API is documented using Swagger, and easily
# viewable from the web browser using Swagger UI. Other frameworks used
# in the project are Flying Saucer, logback, Mockito, JUnit and Wiser.
